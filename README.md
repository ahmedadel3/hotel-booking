Hotel Booking System
======================

A sample hotel reservation booking system written using AngularJS, Express and NodeJS.

Initial setup
=============

I used Yeoman to scaffold this project using the `generator-express-angular` generator.  For this to work, I ran:
    
    npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower
    npm install -g generator-angular
    npm install -g generator-karma
    
Only then was I able to use Yeoman to scaffold the project:

    yo express-angular:app
